<div class="paragraph">
<p>This project portfolio showcases the contributions I have made to Mortago, a software project my team and I built
for CS2103T, a software engineering module.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="about-the-team"><a class="link" href="#about-the-team">About the Team</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our team comprises 5 dedicated Year 2 Computer Science students taking CS2103T.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="about-the-project"><a class="link" href="#about-the-project">About the Project</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our task for CS2103T was to build upon and enhance <a href="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3">Address Book Level 3 (AB3)</a>,
a sample address book application used to teach software engineering. It primarily uses a command line interface (CLI) for user interaction,
and our enhanced application was required to have this as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given a 3 month time span, we decided to morph the application into Mortago, a mortuary management application.
Written in Java, the software totals to around 20,000 lines of code (20 kLoC).
Mortago is a desktop application and is designed to make the mortuary workflow faster and smarter
for mortuary managers in Singapore.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mortago&#8217;s primary purpose is to act as a user-friendly database for mortuaries. A neat and appealing dashboard allows users to see important data with one glance.
Mortago is comprehensive and tracks a mortuary&#8217;s bodies, workers, and fridges. Other than basic commands to manipulate and find data, Mortago also automates fridge management for bodies and
generates critical reminders according to Singapore&#8217;s laws. It also automatically shows key statistics and allows reports to be easily generated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Singapore&#8217;s mortuaries are still using paper records. This idea was conceived because we noticed a gap in the market for
modern mortuary solutions. The user interacts with Mortago using a CLI, and it has a graphical user interface (GUI) created with JavaFX. Knowing that Singapore&#8217;s
mortuary managers are familiar with Microsoft Excel and are comfortable with typing, Mortago&#8217;s CLI is the perfect fit for them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I designed and implemented the undo, redo, and update functionality in Mortago. I was responsible for
the largest base class in Mortago, and also added storage functionality for almost everything in Mortago.
The sections below detail my contributions as well as the documentation I wrote for the user and developer guides.</p>

<h3 id="enhancements"><a class="link" href="#enhancements">Enhancements</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Major enhancement</strong>: I added the ability to undo/redo commands.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: The <code>undo</code> command allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time.
Previously undone commands can be redone by using the redo command.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can
make mistakes and needs a convenient way of undoing them. Undo and redo are utility functions that many users have come to expect in desktop applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: This feature affects existing commands and has to support future commands.
It contains a defensive design to ensure that commands were not undone or redone in error.
It also required a careful analysis of design choices.
In particular, this feature posed these unique challenges:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The design I chose for this feature is challenging to implement, as it requires an individual command to have undo/redo functionality.
Compared to designs in <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc#undoredo-feature">Address Book Level 4</a>
or <a href="https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/website/admin/project-grading.html">module examples</a>, this design requires a lot more effort to implement.
However, it is faster, requires less space, and provides much better scalability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The application carries out automated actions when certain fields are changed, which had to be accounted for in undo/redo&#8217;s implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The application contains automated user-triggered, time-based pop-ups that trigger additional changes. It was extremely important
that undo/redo maintained data integrity. This was especially difficult to do because these automated changes could
happen at any time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Major enhancement</strong>: I morphed the <code>edit</code> command in AB3 to an <code>update</code> command.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: The <code>update</code> command allows users to update any field of a body or worker in Mortago.
The command only requires the updated field itself to be specified, instead of every field.
It can also take in multiple fields to update at once.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: The <code>edit</code> command in AB3 did not support any Mortago-specific entities. Being able
to update the fields of an entity is essential, as the states of entities must be allowed to change.
It was vital that the command didn&#8217;t require every field to be supplied, as it would require excessive user effort.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: The <code>update</code> command took a lot of effort to implement because Mortago&#8217;s entities contain many fields.
For instance, the <code>Body</code> class contains 16 fields. To make updating more efficient and easy to undo or redo, <code>update</code> makes use of special descriptors
to store the fields' values.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Minor enhancement</strong>: I added storage functionality for Mortago&#8217;s entities.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: The storage functionality allows Mortago&#8217;s <code>Body</code>, <code>Worker</code>, <code>Fridge</code>, and <code>Photo</code> objects to be stored on the user&#8217;s
computer. Data is automatically saved after every change to Mortago.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: The storage functionality is critical to Mortago, as its core purpose is to act
as a digital database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: The storage functionality took more effort to implement and write tests for, because Mortago&#8217;s
entities contain many fields. I also had to deal with storing entities that contained other entities.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="undoing-a-command-code-undo-code"><a class="link" href="#undoing-a-command-code-undo-code">Undoing a command: <code>undo</code></a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can undo the effects of the last command you executed with <code>undo</code>.
This command lets you undo up to 10 most recent commands, one at a time.
The commands are undone starting from the most recent to the least recent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Format: <code>undo</code> or <code>u</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>add</code>, <code>update</code>, <code>clear</code>, and <code>delete</code> commands can be undone.
Commands like <code>list</code> or <code>find</code> cannot be undone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Commands caused by automated commands, such as an <code>update</code> command caused by a <code>Notif</code> can be undone and redone.
For example, the automatic status change of a <code>Body</code> from <code>ARRIVED</code> to <code>CONTACT_POLICE</code> is caused by an <code>update</code> and can be undone and redone. However, note that this feature does not support
the <code>Notif</code> itself. For example, if a <code>Body</code> was added and deleted before the <code>Notif</code> associated with it has executed,
undoing the deletion does not restore the <code>Notif</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Though you can <code>undo</code> a <code>clear</code> command, note that you cannot redo any past undone commands after that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Example:<br>
Imagine that you wanted to delete a <code>Body</code> with ID 10 from Mortago. However, your finger slips and you type <code>20</code> instead
of <code>10</code>!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<p>You don&#8217;t realise and execute the command. When you look at the dashboard, you realise you have deleted body 20.
Even worse, you have no recollection of body 20&#8217;s name or information.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can find the core of undo/redo in the undo/redo history of <code>ModelManager</code>.
The history stores <code>UndoableCommands</code>, and an <code>UndoCommand</code> or <code>RedoCommand</code> will <code>undo()</code> or <code>redo()</code> commands in the history.
The design of <code>UndoableCommand</code> uses the Command pattern, a common design pattern often used in software engineering.
It allows each individual command to be undone/redone at a high-level without needing the specific command type to be known.
Classes related to undo/redo and their relationships are shown in Figure 11.</p>

<div class="title">Figure 1. Class Diagram Showing the Architecture of Undo/Redo</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="architecture"><a class="link" href="#architecture">Architecture</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To start off, you will find two instances of <code>CommandHistory</code> in <code>ModelManager</code>. They are  stored internally as <code>commandHistory</code> and <code>undoHistory</code>.
<code>commandHistory</code> stores previously executed commands while <code>undoHistory</code> stores previously undone commands.
<code>CommandHistory</code> wraps a <code>Deque&lt;UndoableCommand&gt;</code>. Its methods imposes a <code>MAX_SIZE</code> which determines how many commands can be stored in the command history.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <code>ModelManager</code>, four key operations to access and modify <code>CommandHistory</code> are implemented:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>ModelManager#addExecutedCommand(UndoableCommand command)</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Adds a command that was executed to the start of <code>commandHistory</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ModelManager#getExecutedCommand()</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Removes the last command that was executed and added to <code>commandHistory</code> and returns it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ModelManager#addUndoneCommand(UndoableCommand command)</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Adds a command that was undone to the start of <code>undoHistory</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ModelManager#getUndoneCommand()</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Removes the last command that was undone and added to <code>undoHistory</code> and returns it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the <code>Model</code> interface implemented by <code>ModelManager</code>, these four operations are respectively exposed as
<code>Model#addExecutedCommand(UndoableCommand command)</code>, <code>Model#getExecutedCommand()</code>, <code>Model#addUndoneCommand(UndoableCommand command)</code>, and <code>Model#getUndoneCommand()</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, the <code>UndoableCommand</code> stored in the <code>Model</code> is actually a normal <code>Command</code> that changes program state.
The <code>UndoableCommand</code> class is an abstract class that extends the abstract <code>Command</code> class, as shown in Figure 11. Commands like <code>AddCommand</code> or <code>UpdateCommand</code> extends <code>UndoableCommand</code> instead of <code>Command</code>.
Commands that don&#8217;t change the user-visible program state, like <code>FindCommand</code>, can still inherit directly from <code>Command</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is where the Command pattern comes in. A class extending <code>UndoableCommand</code> must implement an additional method, <code>UndoableCommand#undo(Model model)</code>. This means that every child class of <code>UndoableCommand</code> has a custom <code>undo</code> implementation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>UndoableCommand#redo(Model model)</code> is a concrete implementation of the <code>redo</code> mechanism and is inherited by all child classes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lastly, undo/redo is initiated when user input creates an <code>UndoCommand</code> or <code>RedoCommand</code>. When either of them are executed, they respectively get the last
executed or undone command from the <code>CommandHistory</code> in <code>ModelManager</code>. As the retrieved command is an instance of <code>UndoableCommand</code>, an attempt will be made to execute <code>UndoableCommand#undo(Model model)</code> or <code>UndoableCommand#redo(Model model)</code>.
If it is successful, undo/redo is succesful. Otherwise, an error message is shown.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is the mechanism of undo/redo, from start to end.</p>

<div class="paragraph">

<h5 id="defensive-programming"><a class="link" href="#defensive-programming">Defensive programming</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To defend against improper undoing or redoing, an <code>UndoableCommand</code> can only be added to the <code>commandHistory</code> or <code>undoHistory</code> of <code>ModelManager</code> through its <code>execute()</code> or <code>undo()</code> method.
Additionally, <code>UndoableCommand</code> contains a small inner class, the enumeration <code>UndoableCommandState</code> which allows an <code>UndoableCommand</code> to have its state set to any value in the enumeration.
The values are as shown below.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>    /**
    * Enumerates through the possible states of an UndoableCommand.
    */
    public enum UndoableCommandState {
        UNDOABLE, REDOABLE, PRE_EXECUTION
    }</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before a command is undone or redone, the command&#8217;s state is checked for validity. An example is shown below in the <code>redo()</code> method.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>    /**
     * Re-executes an UndoableCommand if it had been previously undone.
     */
    public CommandResult redo(Model model) throws CommandException {
        if (getCommandState() != UndoableCommandState.REDOABLE) {
            return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_NOT_UNDONE_BEFORE);
        }
        return execute(model);
    }</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As shown in the code snippet, when an <code>UndoableCommand</code> is redone, the method first checks that its state was set to <code>UNDOABLE</code>.
These states are only changed when a <code>Command#execute(Model model)</code> or <code>UndoableCommand#undo(Model model)</code> has successfully executed.
Therefore, it is unlikely that an <code>UndoableCommand</code> will be unwittingly undone or redone in error.</p>

<p>When designing the undo/redo feature, scalability and speed were the key considerations.
There was also an extra layer of difficulty as Mortago has automated commands that are both time-based and user-triggered.
