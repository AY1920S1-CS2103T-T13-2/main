<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mortago, a desktop application, is a comprehensive mortuary management system. It is a student project from the National University of Singapore (NUS). Mortago is a portmanteau of two Latin words: "mortem" (death) and "curago" (to manage). As its name suggests, Mortago aims to streamline mortuary processes such as updating statuses, keeping track of unclaimed bodies, and generating reports for hospital mortuary managers. The user interacts with MORTAGO using a command line interface (CLI), and it displays a dashboard (Figure 1) that shows bodies, workers and fridges entries.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The interface is responsive to suit different screen sizes. However, due to its detailed interface, it is recommended for larger screen sizes such as desktop monitors. Mortago has a graphical user interface (GUI) created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and maintains a local storage.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The image below shows where the users can type the commands and where the details are displayed:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This project was undertaken by a team of five Year 2 computer science undergraduates, including myself, as part of the NUS module CS2103T Software Engineering. For most of us, it was our first time being part of a small-scale software development team. We were tasked to build the application under the contraints that it must be CLI and targets a small user base.</p>

<h3 id="1-3-about-my-role"><a class="link" href="#1-3-about-my-role">1.3. About My Role</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My role was to design the <code>stats</code>, <code>filter</code>, and <code>find</code> features. The following section elaborates on my work in greater detail. Other than engineering these features, I also contributed to the project documentation (user and developer guides). I will be including excerpts of these contributions in the next section.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before we move there, I would like to highlight the symbols and text formatting that will be used in this document. A grey highlight like <code>stats</code> indicates that this is a command that can be inputted into the command line and executed by the application. Three earlier examples can be seen in this section.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to the
team project.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement 1</strong>: I added the line chart display which shows admissions statistics.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: The line chart displays the number of bodies admitted to the mortuary daily over the last ten days. This is the default view. With the <code>stats</code> command, users can toggle between a ten-day, weekly, monthly, or yearly display. Furthermore, any particular week, month, or year can be specified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: It is important for users to know how many bodies are admitted daily as well as the trends for admission. As managers of the mortuary, they can make staffing decisions on various times of the year depending on the trends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: This feature can be further enhanced by adding more data to the display, for example, another line for bodies claimed daily which can show the average lag time between admission and claim dates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Credits: Support for rendering the line chart was provided by JavaFX.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement 1</strong>: I added the ability to filter entries.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: The <code>filter</code> command allows users to filter body or worker entries by any attributes,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: This is a necessary feature for a system that intends to manage a lot of data. Sometimes, mortuary managers just need to view entries of a specific kind. They can filter entries by sex, status, cause of death, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor enhancement</strong>: I added the ability to find workers or bodies by their name.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Justification: Although the previous command can serve the same purpose, the <code>find</code> command is useful for when the user has a specific entry in mind that they want to view as it is a shorter and more efficient command.</p>

<p><em>{start of extract 1: implementation of stats command}</em>
=== Statistics Feature
==== Implementation</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The statistics feature appears as a line chart of the number of bodies admitted over the past 10 days (default view) and is facilitated by <code>LineChartPanel</code>. It extends <code>UiPart</code> with an internal storage of the number of bodies admitted per day over the past 10 days. The line chart is part of the user interface and is initialised automatically when Mortago is launched. Users can switch the view to a specified week, month, or view.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <code>LineChartPanel</code>, four key operations that constructs the line chart and updates it dynamically are implemented, and they are executed in order as described below:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>LineChartPanel#initialiseTreeMap()</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Initialises a tree map that contains the dates as the keys and the number of bodies admitted as the frequency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>LineChartPanel#initialiseLineChart()</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Creates a Line Chart with Xaxis and Yaxis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>LineChartPanel#updateSeries()</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Adds data to the series of the line chart based on what is in the tree map.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>LineChartPanel#updateUponChanged()</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;If a body is added or removed, the tree map is changed accordingly depending on the date of admission of the body, and the series is updated again.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The above operations are invoked through a wrapper function <code>LineChartPanel#makeLineChart()</code> which is invoked when the user calls <code>LineChartPanel#getLineChart()</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The line chart is updated automatically because it takes in an ObservableList&lt;Body&gt; from the <code>AddressBook</code>, so it re-intialises once a change has been detected. The following sequence diagram shows hows adding a body changes the <code>AddressBook</code>, and then how`LineChartPanel` interacts <code>AddressBook</code> to obtain an observable list of bodies, creates a line chart from it, and then passes the line chart to be displayed in <code>MainWindow</code> with dynamic update:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>)Sequence diagram showing the dynamic update of the line chart when user adds a new body.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The user is able to switch the time frame of the line chart between the last ten days or a particular week, month, or year with the <code>stats</code> command (See User Guide). The following sequence diagram shows how the stats command affect the appearance of the line chart:</p>

<p>The line chart needs data to refer to. Below are two alternatives for how to access the data and update the line chart:</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 1 (current choice):</strong> Data is not stored. Use a tree map to keep track of bodies and initialise the treemap depending on the given time frame.</p>

</ul>

<p>The following activity diagram illustrates the current choice for accessing and updating data:</p>

</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Implementation is easy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Series is regenerated whenever there is a change in time frame. As can be seen from the activity diagram below, the series gets reintialised regardless of whether it will affect a change in the appearance of the line chart.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2:</strong> Store all data in a separate storage class.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pros: No need to reinitialise the treemap everytime a <code>stats</code> command is called.</p>
