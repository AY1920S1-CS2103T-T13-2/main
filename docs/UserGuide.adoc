== Introduction

Mortago is a mortuary management system for hospitals. Mortago is optimized for efficient mortuary managers who *prefer
to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Mortago provides a *convenient dashboard* for the mortuary manager to keep track of all bodies and fridges, outstanding
tasks, and alerts. It replaces and improves upon the traditional whiteboard system. Mortago allows the mortuary management to be more accurate in managing tasks, calculating the availability of space, viewing archives and generating reports automatically.
