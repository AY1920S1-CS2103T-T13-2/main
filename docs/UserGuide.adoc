== Introduction

Mortago is a mortuary management system for hospitals. Mortago is optimized for efficient mortuary managers who *prefer
to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Mortago provides a *convenient dashboard* for the mortuary manager to keep track of all bodies and fridges, outstanding
tasks, and notifs. It replaces and improves upon the traditional whiteboard system. Mortago allows the mortuary
management
to be more accurate in managing tasks, calculating the availability of space, viewing archives and generating reports automatically.

Interested? Refer to <<Quick-Start>> below to get started. Enjoy!

[[Features]]
== Features

This section details a comprehensive walkthrough through the features in Mortago.
In general, commands in Mortago follow a specification that is elaborated on below.

// tag::commandspecs[]
====
*Command Specification*

Most commands in Mortago follow the general format: `COMMAND_WORD -FLAG ATTRIBUTES`

* `COMMAND_WORD` specifies what you want Mortago to do.
** eg. `add` will tell Mortago to create an entry according to the details that you supply in the later half of the command.
* `-FLAG` specifies what type of entity in Mortago you are referring to.
** There are 3 types of entities in Mortago: worker, body and fridge. Each of them has its respective `-FLAG`, given below:
*** `-w` indicates a worker
*** `-b` indicates a body
*** `-f` indicates a fridge
* `ATTRIBUTES` specifies the information about an entity that you need to supply for the command to execute.


*Attributes*

|===
a|
[TIP]
What are `ATTRIBUTES`?
a| Attributes are properties of a worker, body or fridge that are supplied by you when executing a command.

* For example, `name` is an attribute for both body and worker entities.
* The full list of attributes for each entity can be found in <<add, Section 3.1.1>>.

|===

* `ATTRIBUTES` in this User Guide will be represented with the format: `/attributeName attributeValue`

** You should always provide the `/attributeName`, exactly as it is stated in the User Guide, before specifying the details of the `attributeValue` that the entity has.
** For example, if you want to specify the `/name name` of a body with the name "John Doe", you should give it as `/name John Doe`.

* `ATTRIBUTES` are provided successively in commands and Mortago will not prompt you, step by step, the `ATTRIBUTES` you need to provide.
* `ATTRIBUTES` in parentheses are optional.
    ** e.g. The following 2 commands are valid for the add command, with the abridged format: `add -b /name name (/religion religion /status status)`.
        *** `add -b /religion Buddhism`
        *** `add -b /religion Buddhism /status arrived`
* `ATTRIBUTES` specified in a command can be given in any order.
    ** e.g. The following 2 commands are valid for the add command, with the abridged format: `add -b (/religion religion /status status)`.
        *** `add -b /religion Buddhism /status arrived`
        *** `add -b /status arrived /religion Buddhism`
* `ATTRIBUTES` that are tagged with `...` and in square parentheses must be supplied with at least one `ATTRIBUTE`.
    ** For the filter command: `filter [/attributeName attributeValue ...]`::
    *** `filter /name John` and `filter /sex female` are valid commands.
    *** `filter` is an invalid command.


*Identification Number*

* All entries in Mortago have a unique Identification Number tagged to it.
* The identification number is automatically generated by Mortago for your convenience.
* Identification numbers in Mortago have the format as shown below, where `#` is a number from 0-9:
    ** `body` entries: `B\\####\####`
    ** `worker` entries: `W\\#####`
    **  `fridge` entries: `F##`
* If you need to supply the identification number to a command, providing the number (e.g. `20` instead of `W00020`) is sufficient.

====

[TIP]
Before specifying a `fridgeId`, ensure that a `fridge` with this id exists!

---
| Add a new fridge
a|
====
add -f
====

[TIP]
Default status: `UNOCCUPIED`

|===

Example:

|===

| Command | Expected Output

a|

---
| Body added

a|
`add -f`
{nbsp} +



| Fridge added

|===
// end::add[]

// tag::update[]

[[update]]
==== Updating an entity: `update`

This command allows you to update the attributes of a body or worker.

You have to indicate the entity type you want to update with a flag, as described in <<Features>>.
[TIP]
`-f` is not a valid flag for this command. Fridges are automatically updated when bodies are assigned or removed.

You can specify one or more attributes to change, but at least one valid attribute must be provided.

Format: `update -FLAG /id id [/attributeName attributeValue ...]`


|===
| :bulb: a|
When you update the `fridgeId` of a `Body`, changes to the fridges will be made as follows:

* Previous fridge's status is set to `UNOCCUPIED` and is no longer assigned this `Body`.

* New fridge's status is set to `OCCUPIED` and is assigned this `Body`.

When you update the status of a `Body` to `CONTACT_POLICE`, the `Notif` associated with the `Body` will be automatically deleted.

When you update `bodyStatus` to `ARRIVED`, a `Notif` pop-up will be shown after 10 seconds.

|===

There are some attributes that you can update once the entity is created. For this command,
the list of valid attributes and their command prefixes can be found below:
|===

| Entity | Attribute

| Body

a|

Name `/name` +
Sex `/sex` +
NRIC `/nric` +
Date of Birth `/dob` +
Date of Death `/dod` +
Date of Admission `/doa` +
Status `/status` +
Religion `/religion` +
Name of Next-of-Kin `/NOKname` +
Relationship `/relationship` +
Phone Number of Next-of-Kin `/NOKphone` +
Cause of Death `/cod` +
Details `/details` +
Organs For Donation `/organsForDonation` +
Fridge ID `/fridgeId` +

| Worker
a|
Phone Number `/phone` +
Sex `/sex` +
Date of Birth `/dob` +
Date Joined `/dateJoined` +
Designation `/designation` +
Employment Status `/status` +
Photo `/photo`

|===
[TIP]
Make sure you key in dates in the format DD/MM/YYYY.

Example: +
Imagine that someone (Jane Doe) just got promoted! You have to change her designation in Mortago.

Instead of typing out all the irrelevant attributes a Worker has, you just have to input her ID number
and her new designation. You see that her ID number is W00001.

|===

| Command | Expected Output

| `update -w /id 1 /designation Senior Autopsy Technician`

| Designation of Jane Doe changed to Senior Autopsy Technician.

|===

// end::update[]

// tag::find[]

==== Locating entries by name: `find`

Finds bodies or workers whose names contain any of the given keywords. +

Format: `find (flag) (keyword)...`

|===
| :bulb: a|
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`
|===

Format: `find -FLAG [keyword...]`

Examples:

* `find -b John` +
Returns any bodies having names `John`
* `find -w Betsy Tim John` +
Returns any workers having names `Betsy`, `Tim`, or `John`

// end::find[]


// tag::delete[]

==== Deleting a person : `delete`

You can delete a body, worker or fridge entry, using its Identification Number. +

Format: `delete -FLAG  id`

|===
| :bulb: a| When you delete a body, its associated notifications will also be deleted. If a fridge is occupied by a body, you cannot delete it.
|===


* Deletes the body, worker or fridge entry with the specified identification number.

Examples:

* `delete -w 1` +

The worker with the identification number `W00001` will be deleted.

// end::delete

// tag::clear[]

==== Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from Mortago. +
Format: `clear`

// end::clear[]

// tag::list[]

==== List all entries: `list`
List all entries of bodies, workers, or fridges.

Format: `list -FLAG`

|===
| Flags | Usage
| -b | View all bodies.
| -w | View all workers.
| -f | View all fridges.
|===

Example: `list -b` +
Lists all bodies currently in Mortago.

// end::list[]

// tag::select[]

====  Selecting a body: `select`

You can select a body and view its full details by entering a select command.

Format: `select id`

Example: `select 1` +
View a body with the ID B00000001.

// end::select[]

=== General

// tag::notifs[]

==== View notifs panel: `showNotifs`
View all notifications.

A `notif` is automatically created when you could not contact the next of kin within 24 hours from the time
of arrival of the body. For the purpose of testing, this period is set to 10 seconds instead of 24 hours.
The `bodyStatus` will be automatically changed to `CONTACT_POLICE` if it is `ARRVIED` after the 10 second period.
A pop-up window to remind you to contact the police will be shown so that they can search for the body's next of kin.

Once you change the `bodyStatus` to any of the possible bodyStatus instead of `ARRIVED`, the `notif` will be be deleted.
If you change the `bodyStatus` to `ARRIVED`, the associated `notif` for the body will be added and the timer will start from the point in time it is changed.

Format: `showNotifs`

// end::notifs[]

// tag::sortfilter[]

==== Sort all entries: `sort` `[coming in v2.0]`
Sort all displayed entries according to a given order. Only body and worker entries can be sorted.
Sort only works on the entries that are in view. For example, to sort body entries, the you need to first navigate to the bodies view.
Types of ordering can be found below:

* `name`: entries are sorted by alphabetical order of their names
* `id`: entries are sorted by their id number, in descending order (newest entry appear first)
    ** `id asc`: entries are sorted in ascending order of id number
    ** `id desc`: entries are sorted in descending order of id number
         *** If neither 'asc' or 'desc' qualifiers are supplied, the ordering is by default descending.
* `status`: entries are sorted by their statuses in this order:

Format: `sort /order order`

Example:

* `sort /order status` +
All entries will be sorted and grouped according to their statuses.
* `sort /order id asc` +
All entries will be sorted according to their id number in ascending order.

==== Filter all entries: `filter`
This command allows you to filter all entries according to the given keywords in any of an entryâ€™s attributes. All entries with matching keywords will be displayed. Keyword is case-insensitive.

All attributes of a body or worker entry can be filtered. If more than one attribute is specified, the entries displayed must fulfill all attributes. Please refer to <<Section 3.1.1>> for the different fields available to be filtered.

Format: `filter -FLAG [/attributeName attributeValue ...]`

Example:
* `filter -w /sex female` +
All female worker entries will be displayed.

* `filter -b /cod Car Accident /sex male` +
All body entries with car accident as the cause of death and those that are male will be displayed.
// end::sortfilter[]

// tag::undoredo[]
==== Undoing a command: `undo`
This command undoes the effects of the last command you executed. You can undo up to 10 of your most recent commands.
The commands are undone starting from the most recent to the least recent.

Format: `undo` or `u`

|===
|:bulb: a|
Only commands that change Mortago's data can be undone. The `add`, `update`, `clear`, and `delete` commands can be undone.
Commands like `list` or `find` cannot be undone.

You can `undo` a `clear` command, but note that you cannot redo any past undone commands after that.

Automated commands like changes caused by a `Notif` can be undone and redone. For example, the automatic
status change of a `Body` from `ARRIVED` to `CONTACT_POLICE` can be undone.


|===

Example: +
Imagine that you've accidentally deleted the wrong Body (John Doe) from Mortago. You can easily reverse that mistake with the `undo` command instead of adding John Doe all over again!

To undo:

1. Type `undo` or `u` into the command box.
2. Press `Enter` to execute the command.
3. Notice that the result box displays "Undid deleting this entity: <long descriptor of the body>" and John Doe is now back in the list of bodies.


==== Redoing a command: `redo`
This command redoes the effects of the last command you undid.
You can redo up to 10 of your most recent undone commands.
All commands that can be undone can be redone. (See <<Undoing a command: `undo`>> for how `undo` can be used.)

Format: `redo` or `r`

[TIP]
A command can only be redone if it has been undone before.

Example: +
Imagine that you've previously executed `undo` to undo deleting John Doe. You look at the data again and realise you've deleted the right thing after all!

Instead of manually deleting John Doe again, simply `redo` the command.

To redo:

1. Type `redo` or `r` into the command box.
2. Press `Enter` to execute the command.
3. Notice that the result box displays "Deleted this entity: <long descriptor of the body>" and John Doe is now absent from the list of bodies.

// end::undoredo[]

// tag::exit[]

==== Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program. +
Format: `exit`

// end::exit[]

// tag::documentGeneration[]
