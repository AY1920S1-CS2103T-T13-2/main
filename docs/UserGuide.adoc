== Introduction

Mortago is a mortuary management system for hospitals. Mortago is optimized for efficient mortuary managers who *prefer
to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Mortago provides a *convenient dashboard* for the mortuary manager to keep track of all bodies and fridges, outstanding
tasks, and notifs. It replaces and improves upon the traditional whiteboard system. Mortago allows the mortuary
management
to be more accurate in managing tasks, calculating the availability of space, viewing archives and generating reports automatically.

Interested? Refer to <<Quick-Start>> below to get started. Enjoy!

[[Features]]
== Features

This section details a comprehensive walkthrough through the features in Mortago.
In general, commands in Mortago follow a specification that is elaborated on below.

// tag::commandspecs[]
====
*Command Specification*

Most commands in Mortago follow the general format: `COMMAND_WORD -FLAG ATTRIBUTES`

* `COMMAND_WORD` specifies what you want Mortago to do.
** eg. `add` will tell Mortago to create an entry according to the details that you supply in the later half of the command.
* `-FLAG` specifies what type of entity in Mortago you are referring to.
** There are 3 types of entities in Mortago: worker, body and fridge. Each of them has its respective `-FLAG`, given below:
*** `-w` indicates a worker
*** `-b` indicates a body
*** `-f` indicates a fridge
* `ATTRIBUTES` specifies the information about an entity that you need to supply for the command to execute.


*Attributes*

|===
a|
[TIP]
What are `ATTRIBUTES`?
a| Attributes are properties of a worker, body or fridge that are supplied by you when executing a command.

* For example, `name` is an attribute for both body and worker entities.
* The full list of attributes for each entity can be found in <<add, Section 3.1.1>>.

|===

* `ATTRIBUTES` in this User Guide will be represented with the format: `/attributeName attributeValue`

** You should always provide the `/attributeName`, exactly as it is stated in the User Guide, before specifying the details of the `attributeValue` that the entity has.
** For example, if you want to specify the `/name name` of a body with the name "John Doe", you should give it as `/name John Doe`.

* `ATTRIBUTES` are provided successively in commands and Mortago will not prompt you, step by step, the `ATTRIBUTES` you need to provide.
* `ATTRIBUTES` in parentheses are optional.
** e.g. The following 2 commands are valid for the add command, with the abridged format: `add -b /name name (/religion religion /status status)`.
*** `add -b /religion Buddhism`
*** `add -b /religion Buddhism /status arrived`
* `ATTRIBUTES` specified in a command can be given in any order.
** e.g. The following 2 commands are valid for the add command, with the abridged format: `add -b (/religion religion /status status)`.
*** `add -b /religion Buddhism /status arrived`
*** `add -b /status arrived /religion Buddhism`
* `ATTRIBUTES` that are tagged with `...` and in square parentheses must be supplied with at least one `ATTRIBUTE`.
** For the filter command: `filter [/attributeName attributeValue ...]`::
*** `filter /name John` and `filter /sex female` are valid commands.
*** `filter` is an invalid command.


*Identification Number*

* All entries in Mortago have a unique Identification Number tagged to it.
* The identification number is automatically generated by Mortago for your convenience.
* Identification numbers in Mortago have the format as shown below, where `#` is a number from 0-9:
** `body` entries: `B\\####\####`
** `worker` entries: `W\\#####`
**  `fridge` entries: `F##`
* If you need to supply the identification number to a command, providing the number (e.g. `20` instead of `W00020`) is sufficient.

=== Create, Read, Update and Delete Entities

// tag::add[]
This section details various commands to manage your entity entries in Mortago.

[[add]]
==== Add an entity: `add`

You can add a body, worker or fridge by entering an add command that follows the format given below.

*Format*: +
This table details how you can craft your add command to add an entity in Mortago.
|===

| Purpose |  Format

(/relationship relationshipOfNextOfKin) +
(/NOKphone phoneOfNextOfKin) +
(/cod causeOfDeath) +
(/organsForDonation organsForDonation) +
(/fridgeId fridgeId)
====

[TIP]
Before specifying a `fridgeId`, ensure that a `fridge` with this id exists!

|===

Example:

|===

| Command | Expected Output

a|
`add -w
 /name Mary
 /phone 87654321
 /sex female
 /dateJoined 18/08/2019

---
| Body added

|===
// end::add[]

// tag::update[]

[[update]]
==== Updating an entity: `update`

This command allows you to update the attributes of a body or worker. +

You have to indicate the entity type you want to update with a flag, as described in <<Features>>.
[TIP]
`-f` is not a valid flag for this command. Fridges are automatically updated when bodies are assigned or removed.

You can specify one or more attributes to change, but at least one valid attribute must be provided.

Format: `update -FLAG /id id [/attributeName attributeValue ...]`



When you update the `fridgeId` of a `Body`, changes to the fridges will be made as follows:

* Previous fridge's status is set to `UNOCCUPIED` and is no longer assigned this `Body`.

* New fridge's status is set to `OCCUPIED` and is assigned this `Body`.

When you update the status of a `Body` to `CONTACT_POLICE`, the `Notif` associated with the `Body` will be automatically deleted.

When you update `bodyStatus` to `ARRIVED`, a `Notif` pop-up will be shown after 10 seconds.


There are some attributes that you can update once the entity is created. For this command,
the list of valid attributes and their command prefixes can be found below:

|===
| Entity | Attribute

| Body
a|
Name `/name` +
Sex `/sex` +
NRIC `/nric` +
Date of Birth `/dob` +
Date of Death `/dod` +
Date of Admission `/doa` +
Status `/status` +
Religion `/religion` +
Name of Next-of-Kin `/NOKname` +
Relationship `/relationship` +
Phone Number of Next-of-Kin `/NOKphone` +
Cause of Death `/cod` +
Details `/details` +
Organs For Donation `/organsForDonation` +
Fridge ID `/fridgeId` +

| Worker
a|
Phone Number `/phone` +
Sex `/sex` +
Date of Birth `/dob` +
Date Joined `/dateJoined` +
Designation `/designation` +
Employment Status `/status` +
Photo `/photo`

|===
[TIP]
Make sure you key in dates in the format DD/MM/YYYY.

Example: +
Imagine that someone (Jane Doe) just got promoted! You have to change her designation in Mortago.

Instead of typing out all the irrelevant attributes a Worker has, you just have to input her ID number
and her new designation. You see that her ID number is W00001.

|===
| Command | Expected Output

| `update -w /id 1 /designation Senior Autopsy Technician`
| Designation of Jane Doe changed to Senior Autopsy Technician.
|===
// end::update[]

// tag::find[]

==== Locating entries by name: `find`

Finds bodies or workers whose names contain any of the given keywords. +

Format: `find (flag) (keyword)...`

[TIP]
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`


Format: `find -FLAG [keyword...]`

Examples:

* `find -b John` +
Returns any bodies having names `John`
* `find -w Betsy Tim John` +
Returns any workers having names `Betsy`, `Tim`, or `John`

// end::find[]


// tag::delete[]

==== Deleting an entry : `delete` +

This command allows you to delete a body, worker or fridge entry using its Identification Number. +

Format: `delete -FLAG  id`

You only need to enter the numeric value of the Identification Number while ignoring the prefixed 0s. For example, if
you want to delete a `Fridge` with id `F01`, you need to only enter `1`.

When you delete a `Body`:

* Mortago will automatically delete its associated `Notifs`. You can learn more
about `Notifs` in <<add, Section 3.2.1>>.
* If you had assigned a `Fridge` to this `Body`, Mortago will automatically set the status of the `Fridge` to
`UNOCCUPIED`.

You cannot delete a `Fridge` with status `OCCUPIED`. To still proceed with deletion, you need to either delete the
`Body` or assign it to another `Fridge`.

Example:

Imagine that you added someone (Jim Kerr) by mistake and you want to remove his details from Mortago. You see that his
ID number is W00003.

To delete his record:

1) Type `delete -w 3` and press `ENTER` to execute it.

image::delete-command/DeleteStep1.png[align="center"]

2) The result box will display the message as shown below.

image::delete-command/DeleteStep2.png[align="center"]

3) And you can check that Jim Kerr is no longer in the list of workers.

image::delete-command/DeleteStep3.png[align="center"]

// end::delete

// tag::clear[]

==== Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from Mortago. +
Format: `clear`

// end::clear[]

// tag::list[]

==== List all entries: `list`
List all entries of bodies, workers, or fridges.

Format: `list -FLAG`

|===
| Flags | Usage
| -b | View all bodies.
| -w | View all workers.
| -f | View all fridges.
|===

Example: `list -b` +
Lists all bodies currently in Mortago.

// end::list[]

// tag::select[]

====  Selecting a body: `select`

You can select a body and view its full details by entering a select command.

Format: `select id`

Example: `select 1` +
View a body with the ID B00000001.

// end::select[]

=== General

// tag::notifs[]

==== View notifs panel: `showNotifs` +
View all notifications.

In Singapore, if the next-of-kin is not contactable for more than 24 hours from the time of admission of a `Body`,
police must informed. Mortago removes the hassle of manually keeping track of the status of bodies! For the purpose of testing, instead of 24 hours, Mortago currently
uses 10 seconds.

When you add a `Body` or manually set its status to `ARRIVED`, Mortago automatically
changes the status of a `Body` to `CONTACT_POLICE` and shows a pop-up notification to remind you to
contact the police. It creates a `Notif` for all such bodies which you can view by either clicking on the
notification bell or typing the `showNotif` command.

Format: `showNotifs`

Once you change the status of a `Body` from `CONTACT_POLICE` to any other possible status (!!!add in the section!!!),
its associated `Notif` is deleted.

Example:

Imagine that a new `Body` (John Doe) has just arrived at your mortuary.

1) Type the `add` command as specified in the example in <<add, Section 3.1.1>>. Currently the status of the `Body`
is `ARRIVED`

image::notif-command/Notif1.png[align="center"]

2) Wait for 10 seconds. Mortago automatically changes the status of the `Body` to `CONTACT_POLICE` and shows
you a
pop-up
notification.

image::notif-command/Notif2.png[align="center"]

3) Type `showNotif` and press `ENTER` to execute it.

image::notif-command/Notif3.png[align="center"]

4) The notification bell opens up a pop-over and lists all the bodies for which you need to contact the police. You
can see John Doe's ID number B00000011 is in the list.

image::notif-command/Notif4.png[align="center"]

5) Suppose you have contacted the police, change the status of John Doe using the command `update -b /id 11 /status
pending police report`. John Doe's ID is no longer listed in the pop-over.

image::notif-command/Notif5.png[align="center"]

// end::notifs[]

// tag::sortfilter[]

==== Filter all entries: `filter`
This command allows you to filter all entries according to the given keywords in any of an entryâ€™s attributes. All entries with matching keywords will be displayed. Keyword is case-insensitive.

All attributes of a body or worker entry can be filtered. If more than one attribute is specified, the entries displayed must fulfill all attributes. Please refer to <<Section 3.1.1>> for the different fields available to be filtered.

Format: `filter -FLAG [/attributeName attributeValue ...]`

Example:
* `filter -w /sex female` +
All female worker entries will be displayed.

* `filter -b /cod Car Accident /sex male` +
All body entries with car accident as the cause of death and those that are male will be displayed.
// end::sortfilter[]

// tag::undoredo[]
==== Undoing a command: `undo`

This command undoes the effects of the last command you executed. You can undo up to 10 of your most recent commands.
The commands are undone starting from the most recent to the least recent.

Format: `undo` or `u`

The `add`, `update`, `clear`, and `delete` commands can be undone.
Commands like `list` or `find` cannot be undone.

Changes caused by automated commands, such as a `NotifCommand` can be undone and redone.
For example, the automatic status change of a `Body` from `ARRIVED` to `CONTACT_POLICE` can be undone. However, note that this feature does not support
the `NotifCommand` itself.


Though you can `undo` a `clear` command, note that you cannot redo any past undone commands after that.

Example: +
Imagine that you've accidentally deleted the wrong Body (John Doe) from Mortago. You can easily reverse that mistake with the `undo` command instead of adding John Doe all over again!

To undo:

1) Type `undo` or `u` into the command box.

2) Press `Enter` to execute the command.

3) Notice that the result box displays "Undid deleting this entity: <long descriptor of the body>" and John Doe is now
back in the list of bodies.


==== Redoing a command: `redo`

This command redoes the effects of the last command you undid.
You can redo up to 10 of your most recent undone commands.
All commands that can be undone can be redone. (See <<Undoing a command: `undo`>> for how `undo` can be used.)

Format: `redo` or `r`

[TIP]
A command can only be redone if it has been undone before.

Example: +
Imagine that you've previously executed `undo` to undo deleting John Doe. You look at the data again and realise you've deleted the right thing after all!

Instead of manually deleting John Doe again, simply `redo` the command.

To redo:

1) Type `redo` or `r` into the command box.

2) Press `Enter` to execute the command.

3) Notice that the result box displays "Deleted this entity: <long descriptor of the body>" and John Doe is now absent
from the list of bodies.

// end::undoredo[]

// tag::exit[]

==== Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program. +
Format: `exit`

// end::exit[]

// tag::sortfilter[]

==== Sort all entries: `sort` `[coming in v2.0]`
Sort all displayed entries according to a given order. Only body and worker entries can be sorted.
Sort only works on the entries that are in view. For example, to sort body entries, the you need to first navigate to the bodies view.
Types of ordering can be found below:

* `name`: entries are sorted by alphabetical order of their names
* `id`: entries are sorted by their id number, in descending order (newest entry appear first)
** `id asc`: entries are sorted in ascending order of id number
** `id desc`: entries are sorted in descending order of id number
*** If neither 'asc' or 'desc' qualifiers are supplied, the ordering is by default descending.
* `status`: entries are sorted by their statuses in this order:

Format: `sort /order order`

Example:

* `sort /order status` +
All entries will be sorted and grouped according to their statuses.
* `sort /order id asc` +
All entries will be sorted according to their id number in ascending order.


// tag::documentGeneration[]

=== Administrative
==== View admission statistics: `stats`
This command allows you to view a the statistics of the number of bodies admitted to the morgue over the past 10 days, a specific week, a specific month, or a specific year.

The statistics appear in graphical form as a line-chart on the main page of the application. The line chart is initialised automatically and you do not need to enter a command to see it. By default, the line-chart displayed shows the number of bodies admitted over the past 10 days and is automatically updated when a body is added or deleted. You can change the time frame with the commands.

The following is the correct format for typing in stats commands, with example usage:

* To display the last 10 days: `stats` +
The line chart will display statistics over the last 10 days.

* To display a specific week: `stats /week 12/10/2019` +
The line chart will display statistics for the week which contains the specified day. In this case, it is the date 12/10/2019.
