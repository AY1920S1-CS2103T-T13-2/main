== Introduction

Mortago is a mortuary management system for hospitals. Mortago is optimized for efficient mortuary managers who *prefer
to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Mortago provides a *convenient dashboard* for the mortuary manager to keep track of all bodies and fridges, outstanding
tasks, and alerts. It replaces and improves upon the traditional whiteboard system. Mortago allows the mortuary management to be more accurate in managing tasks, calculating the availability of space, viewing archives and generating reports automatically.

[[Quick-Start]]
== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have `Java 11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `mortago.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for Mortago.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:


* *`list -b`* : lists all bodies
* *`workers`* : switches to the workers tab
* **`add -w`**`/firstName John /lastName Doe /dob 17-05-1980` :
adds a worker named John Doe (with his date of birth) to the management system.
* **`delete -w`**`2` : deletes the worker with staff ID W000002
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Command Specification*

Most commands in Mortago are specified with the general format: `COMMAND_WORD -FLAG ATTRIBUTES`

* `COMMAND_WORD` specifies what you want Mortago to do.
** eg. `add` will tell Mortago to create an entry according to the details that you supply in the later half of the command.
* `-FLAG` specifies what type of entry you are referring to.
** There are 3 types of entries in Mortago: worker, body and fridge. The list below details what each of the following `-FLAG` refers to.
*** `-w` indicates a worker
*** `-b` indicates a body
*** `-f` indicates a fridge
* `ATTRIBUTES` specifies the information that you need to supply for the command to execute.


*Attributes*

|===
| :bulb: What are `ATTRIBUTES`?
a| Attributes are properties of a worker, body or fridge that are supplied by you when executing a command.

* e.g. `name` is an attribute for both body and worker entries.
* The full list of attributes for each entry can be found in <<add, Section 3.1.1>>.

|===

* `ATTRIBUTES` are represented with the format: `/attributeName attribute`

** The `/attributeName` should always be given before specifying the information of the `attribute` that the entry has.
** eg. when specifying the `/name name` of a body with the name "John Doe", it should be given as `/name John Doe`.


* `ATTRIBUTES` in parentheses are optional.
    ** e.g. The following 2 commands are valid for the update command, with the abridged format: `update -b (/religion religion /status status)`.
        *** `update -b /religion Buddhist`
        *** `update -b /religion Buddhist /status released`
* `ATTRIBUTES` specified in a command can be given in any order.
    ** e.g. The following 2 commands are valid for the update command, with the abridged format: `update -b (/religion religion /status status)`.
        *** `update -b /religion Buddhist /status released`
        *** `update -b /status released /religion Buddhist`
* Commands with fields tagged with `...` must be supplied at least one `ATTRIBUTE` argument. For example, when `...` appears in parentheses, it means that you must supply at least one or more valid arguments.
    ** For the filter command: `filter (/attributeName attributeValue ...)`
    , these are all valid commands:
    *** `filter /firstName John` and `filter /sex F` are valid commands.
    *** `filter` is an invalid command.


*Identification Number*

* Some commands require a -flag while some are optional. List of flags:
    ** -b: to indicate a `body` entry
    ** -w: to indicate a `worker` entry
    ** -f: to indicate a `fridge` entry
    ** -v: view the verbose description of all commands and their flags.
    *** For example, `update -b /id 1 /name John Bear`
is a valid command that uses a flag.


* All entries in Mortago have a unique idfentification number tagged to it.

* The identification number is automatically generated by Mortago for your convenience.

* Identification numbers in Mortago have the format as shown below, where `#` is a number from 0-9:
    ** `body` entries: `B\\####\####`
    ** `worker` entries: `W\\#####`
    **  `fridge` entries: `F##`

* If you need to supply the identification number to a command, providing the number (e.g. `20` instead of `W00020`) is sufficient.
