== Introduction

Mortago is a mortuary management system for hospitals. Mortago is optimized for efficient mortuary managers who *prefer
to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Mortago provides a *convenient dashboard* for the mortuary manager to keep track of all bodies and fridges, outstanding
tasks, and alerts. It replaces and improves upon the traditional whiteboard system. Mortago allows the mortuary management to be more accurate in managing tasks, calculating the availability of space, viewing archives and generating reports automatically.

* **`add -w`**`/firstName John /lastName Doe /dob 17-05-1980` :
adds a worker named John Doe (with his date of birth) to the management system.
* **`delete -w`**`100200` : deletes the worker with staff ID W100200

====
*Command Specification*

* The word after an `/attributeName` should be provided by you.
    ** e.g. In the sort command `sort /order status`, you must replace `status` with your own input.
* Words in parentheses are optional.
    ** e.g. `update -b (/religion religion /status status)` can be used as either of these:
        *** update -b /religion Buddhist
        *** update -b /religion Buddhist /status released
* Parameters in parentheses can be given in any order.
    ** e.g. These both result in the same command
        *** `update -b /religion Buddhist /status released`
        *** `update -b /status released /religion Buddhist`


* Commands that require `/attributeName` must be supplied with the respective name of the attribute which belong to the worker, fridge, or body.
The types of attributes for each entry can be found in <<add, 3.1.1>>

|===

| :bulb: What are attributes?
| Attributes are properties of a body, fridge or worker that are supplied by you when creating a body, fridge, or worker entry.
    +
    e.g. `firstName` is an attribute for both body and worker entries.


|===

* Commands with fields tagged with `...` must be supplied at least one argument. When `...` appears after
a parenthesis, it means that you can supply one or more arguments.
    ** `filter (/attributeName attributeValue)...`
    ** `filter /firstName John` and `filter /sex F` are valid commands.


* Some commands require a -flag while some are optional. List of flags:
    ** -b: to indicate a `body` entry
    ** -w: to indicate a `worker` entry
    ** -f: to indicate a `fridge` entry
    ** -v: view the verbose description of all commands and their flags.



* The identification number of these objects are automatically generated by Mortago for your convenience.
If you need to supply the identification number to a command, giving the number (e.g. `20`) is enough.
The identification number is in the format as shown:
    ** `body` entries: `B\\####\####`
    ** `worker` entries: `W\\#####`
    **  `fridge` entries: `F##`
