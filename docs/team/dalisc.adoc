= Project: MORTAGO v1.4

---

== Introduction

=== About the Project

MORTAGO, a desktop application, is a comprehensive mortuary management system. MORTAGO is a portmanteau of two Latin words: "mortem" (death) and "curago" (to manage). As its name suggests, MORTAGO aims to streamline mortuary processes such as updating statuses, keeping track of unclaimed bodies, and generating reports for hospital mortuary managers. The user interacts with MORTAGO using a command line interface (CLI), and it displays a dashboard (Figure 1) that shows bodies, workers and fridges entries.

The interface is responsive to suit different screen sizes. However, due to its detailed interface, it is recommended for larger screen sizes such as desktop monitors. MORTAGO has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about __ kLoC. MORTAGO maintains a local storage.

The screenshot below shows where the users can type the commands and where the details are displayed:

=== About the Team

This project was undertaken by a team of five Year 2 computer science undergraduates, including myself, as part of the module CS2103T Software Engineering at the National University of Singapore. For most of us, it was our first time being part of a small-scale software development team. We were tasked to build the application under the following contraints:

* The product has to be a command line interface (CLI).
* The target user base is narrow.

We have thus developed this software that is mostly CLI, save the option for clicking navigation menu and entries, and to be targeted for mortuary managers.

=== About My Role

My role was to design the `stats`, `filter`, and `find` features. The following section elaborates on my work in greater detail. Other than engineering these features, I also contributed to the project documentation (user and developer guides). I will be including excerpts of these contributions in the next section.

Before we move there, I would like to highlight the symbols and text formatting that will be used in this document, which are as follows:

This symbol indicates important information.

A grey highlight (called mark-up) indicates that this is a command that can be inputted into the command line and executed by the application. Three earlier examples can be seen in this section.

Blue text indicates a component, class or object in the architecture of the application.

== Summary of contributions

This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to the
team project.

* *Major enhancement 1*: I added the line chart display which shows admissions statistics.
** What it does: The line chart displays the number of bodies admitted to the mortuary daily over the last ten days. This is the default view. With the `stats` command, users can toggle between a ten-day, weekly, monthly, or yearly display. Furthermore, any particular week, month, or year can be specified. 
** Justification: It is important for users to know how many bodies are admitted daily as well as the trends for admission. As managers of the mortuary, they can make staffing decisions on various times of the year depending on the trends.
** Highlights: This feature can be further enhanced by adding more data to the display, for example, another line for bodies claimed daily which can show the average lag time between admission and claim dates.
** Credits: Support for rendering the line chart was provided by JavaFX.

* *Major enhancement 1*: I added the ability to filter entries.
** What it does: The `filter` command allows users to filter body or worker entries by any attributes,
** Justification: This is a necessary feature for a system that intends to manage a lot of data. Sometimes, mortuary managers just need to view entries of a specific kind. They can filter entries by sex, status, cause of death, etc.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* *Minor enhancement*: I added the ability to find workers or bodies by their name.
** Justification: Although the previous command can serve the same purpose, the `find` command is useful for when the user has a specific entry in mind that they want to view as it is a shorter and more efficient command.

* *Other contributions*:

** Enhancements to existing features: I wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from __% to __%. (Pull request: https://github.com[#36])
** Documentation: I made cosmetic tweaks to existing contents of the User Guide to make it more reader-friendly.(Pull request: https://github.com[#36])
** Community: 
*** I reviewed PRs, offering non-trivial review comments. (Exampless: https://github.com[#36])
*** I reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (Examples:  https://github.com[1], https://github.com[2], https://github.com[3])
