= Project: MORTAGO v1.4

---

== Introduction

=== About the Project

MORTAGO, a desktop application, is a comprehensive mortuary management system. MORTAGO is a portmanteau of two Latin words: "mortem" (death) and "curago" (to manage). As its name suggests, MORTAGO aims to streamline mortuary processes such as updating statuses, keeping track of unclaimed bodies, and generating reports for hospital mortuary managers. The user interacts with MORTAGO using a command line interface (CLI), and it displays a dashboard (Figure 1) that shows bodies, workers and fridges entries.

The interface is responsive to suit different screen sizes. However, due to its detailed interface, it is recommended for larger screen sizes such as desktop monitors. MORTAGO has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about __ kLoC. MORTAGO maintains a local storage.

The screenshot below shows where the users can type the commands and where the details are displayed:

=== About the Team

This project was undertaken by a team of four Year 2 computer science undergraduates, including myself, as part of the module CS2103T Software Engineering at the National University of Singapore. For most of us, it was our first time being part of a small-scale software development team. We were tasked to build the application under the following contraints:

* The product has to be a command line interface (CLI).
* The target user base is narrow.

We have thus developed this software that is mostly CLI, save the option for clicking navigation menu and entries, and to be targeted for mortuary managers.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to undo/redo previous commands*
** What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
