= Bahety Arjavi - Project Portfolio for Mortago

== Introduction

=== About the Team

My team of 5 software engineering students was tasked to work on a desktop application supporting command line
interface.

=== About the Project
We were given the code for <insert link>Address Book 3 and we chose to morph it to suit a mortuary management system
called *Mortago*.

My key role was to design and implement the notification feature as well as the `Fridge` class. In
addition, I morphed the `delete` command. The following sections will elaborate on these features, as well as my
contributions to the user and develop guide documentation for them.

The following are the frequently used symbols used in this document:

*Enhancement Added:* I added the notification feature. <How to add in more features?>

* What it does: It reminds the mortuary manager to contact the police after 10 seconds by automatically changing the
status of the body and showing a pop-up alert.
* Justification: If the next-of-kin of a body has been uncontactable for more than 24 hours, police must be notified
to start a more thorough investigation. It can be tedious for the mortuary manager to manually keep checking which
bodies have crosses the 24 hour window. This feature serves the dual purpose of automatically changing the status of
the body as well as reminding the manager. For the purpose of testing, the time window was set to 10 seconds instead
of 24 hours.
* Highlights: This command makes use of threading to update the body status after 10 seconds. Reflecting changes in
the UI was particularly challenging because JavaFX works on a separate thread from the main Logic commands.
* Credits: @bjhoohaha/duke's AlertWindow.java was reused to create `NotifWindow`.
